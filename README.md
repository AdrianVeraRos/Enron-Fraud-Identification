## About
Founded in 1985, Enron became one of the largest companies in the United States during the 90’s. Little was known that this growth was founded on illegal accounting practices and corporate fraud. By the end of 2001 it filed for bankruptcy and became one of the biggest cases of fraud worldwide.

During the Federal Investigation that followed, confidential information like emails and personal financial data became public. With this information, our objective is to be able to identify if someone was involved in the fraud through machine learning classification algorithms.

The objective of this project is to use machine learning to build a “Person of Interest” identifier for the Enron fraud case.

## Project Outline

This project was build with Python 2.7 and the scikit_learn library. 

The code for this project is in poi_id.py, while the final report for Udacity is on Enron_POI_identifier.pdf

In the tester folder can be found the files created with poi_id.py to be tested with tester.py; provided by Udacity.
